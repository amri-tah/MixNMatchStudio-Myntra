# Myntra: Build for Gen Z üëóüåü
## Problem Statement

Traditional retail models are failing to resonate with Gen Z, a critical demographic in the fashion industry. This digitally-native generation craves unique experiences that transcend mere transactions.

### Key Challenges

1. **Visualization Gap**: Difficulty in visualizing outfit combinations hinders customer satisfaction and purchase decisions, ultimately impacting sales.
   
2. **Limited Engagement**: Gen Z seeks interactive platforms that fuel self-expression. Traditional retail's static environment fails to provide this, leading to lower customer retention.
   
3. **Community Disconnect**: The absence of social interaction and community building, central to Gen Z's online experience, weakens loyalty and engagement within traditional retail spaces.

## Use Cases

- Engagement on a Shopping Platform üõçÔ∏è
- Social Shopping Integration üì≤

## Solution

### MixNMatch Studio

Integrated into the Myntra website, this tool allows users to browse and combine catalog items to visualize complete outfits.

- **Drag and Drop** from catalog to experiment with different outfit combinations.
- **Visualize outfits** on yourself with generative AI.
- **Save privately**, **Publish publicly**, or **Buy combination directly**.
- Seamless and interactive shopping experience.

By bridging the visualization gap, customers can see how different items come together, enhancing customer satisfaction and aiding purchase decisions. This feature also highlights hidden gems in our catalog. As users share their unique collections, previously unnoticed clothing items gain visibility and reach.

## How We Built It
### Segmentation: 
We built the Cloth Segmentation Project using the U2NET model for precise segmentation of various clothing items. Utilizing essential libraries like `os`, `requests`, `PIL`, `cv2`, `argparse`, `numpy`, `torch`, `torchvision`, and `matplotlib`, we structured the project with scripts dedicated to tops, bottoms, coords, and skirts. These scripts download images, generate segmentation masks using the pretrained U2NET model, and save the results in specific directories. The core process involves creating alpha masks and transparent background images, with outputs organized for easy access and validation. This modular approach ensures scalability and efficiency, enabling accurate cloth segmentation for diverse applications.
